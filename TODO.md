#### Future plans
- Protect your code library from regressions by using solved problems as regression tests.
All you have to do is download tests from contest's page and point them to `cu`.

#### Todo
- example/: add Makefile and dir structure
- workspace generator
- usage docs
- `cusubmit`: wrapper for Codeforces API, with potential to be extensible for other sites
- convenient adding hand-written tests
- support in example/Makefile for many source files
- `culibtest add`, `culibtest run` `culibtest list` - library tests based on solved problems
